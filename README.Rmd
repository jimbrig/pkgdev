# R Package Developer's Toolkit - `pkgdev`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `pkgdev` is to provide the R Package Developer a suite of tools to 
simplify and aid the various processes involved with creating, developing, 
testing, maintaining, and overall management of their R Packages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `pkgdev` with `pak` like so: [^1]

```r
pak::pak("jimbrig/pkgdev")
```

## Usage

`pkgdev` comes with many tools out-of-the-box for package developer's in R to quickly 
get started:

### Create a new package

To create a new R package locally, run `pkgdev::create_pkg()`:

```R
pkgdev::create_pkg("myawesomepkg", pkgdevt_script = TRUE, github = TRUE)
```

This will perform the following steps:

1. Create a new directory called `myawesomepkg`
2. Initialize an RStudio project, `myawesomepkg.Rproj`, within that directory
3. 



***

[^1]: Similarly, you can install the package using the more common `devtools::install_github()` and `remotes::install_github()`. If you need to install `pak`, install the development version using `install.packages("pak", repos = "https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/devel/")`.
